# 🧠 30-Day DSA Interview Prep Plan (2–5 hrs/week)

This repository tracks my **30-day Data Structures & Algorithms interview preparation**.  
The goal is **pattern mastery**, not grinding — focusing on problems commonly asked in SWE / SDET / QA / DevOps interviews.

**Primary language:** Python  
**Secondary language:** C++ (for reinforcement & performance intuition)

---

## 📌 Rules of Engagement

- ⏱ Target **30–40 minutes per problem**
- 🧠 If stuck >15 minutes → step back, reason, then peek
- ✅ Mark complete only if I can **explain the solution out loud**
- ❌ No blind memorization
- 🐍 Default to Python unless otherwise stated
